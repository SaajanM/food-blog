## About The Site

An enjoyment of food has been at the forefront of my life for as long as I can
remember. Almost as important to me is having a catalog of meals to look back
upon in later life. The hope is that the pictures and experiences documented
within can serve as a touchstone to remember my youth and to observe how I have
changed as I've aged.

These posts originally would mostly be short notes shared amongst my friends,
but I often wondered if I could start sharing with a wider audience. This blog
aims to be my answer to that.

Each post in this blog documents an individual experience surrounding a meal
that I have had, be it a frozen TV dinner, a homemade breakfast burrito, a
tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant, or anything in between. The post
will contain a brief review of the meal, a rating following the guide below, and
a more lengthy discussion of the meal's circumstances.

## The Rating Guide

The ratings on this blog are mostly nonsensical, as I like food too much to be
objective on any particular dish (if a sense of objectivity is even humanly
possible). With this in mind let me unveil the world's greatest rating schema!

### General Format

Each and every rating will appear in the format `[score] [emoji] [+/-]`. See
below for the breakdown of each part.

#### `[score]`

| Score | Meaning                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Death | I should not have eaten this. I think I might die. |
| Bad   | It certainly is edible.                            |
| Ok    | It was fine but not something I would crave.       |
| Good  | It was something I enjoyed eating.                 |
| Great | It was superb, and I wish I could have more.       |
| Peak  | Does there exist anything better in the cosmos?    |

#### `[emoji]`

The accompanying emoji to each rating will convey -- as is the point of emojis
-- my principal emotion during this meal. Use your best judgement when decoding
the riddles within.

#### `[+/-]`

Ratings need to be context aware. You can't say that a 15 course meal from a
fancy restaurant on your birthday is somehow better or worse than a home cooked
stew your parents make you when you are sick.

Well you could, I suppose, but you would also be wrong.

With this in mind, each of the ratings will be appended by a `+` or a `-`. This
will answer the question of

> "Given the context, was this meal something that was 'worth it'?"

for whatever definition of *'worth it'* makes sense.

| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Death 🙏 +`                                   | I found some berries on the side of a mountain while starving. They saved me from malnourishment but they tasted like poison. |
| `Great 💸 -`                                   | The meal was fantastic, but it cost way too much money                                                                        |
| `Ok 😑 +`                                      | The average meal. It was fine and I would eat it again                                                                        |
