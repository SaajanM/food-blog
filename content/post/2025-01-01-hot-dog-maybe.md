## Discussion

I'll keep this one short. Really, this kind of meal is what really reminds me of
why I enjoy living alone. I mean, it's complete slop and hardly qualifies as a
hot dog to begin with, since it's vegetarian!

Only living alone would I dare craft something so delightfully mid. You could
not get me to make something like this for anyone.

I messed up the condiments and had to slather it all together, so you can't even
see the dogs underneath! Uncouth to the highest order.

And yet I love 'em. A true comfort food that really takes no work at all.

With that, let me ask you this: "does this even look like a hot dog"?

## Review

Totally mid and totally worth it.

I made them by taking out some frozen Light Life veggie dogs from the freezer,
and tossed them in some boiling water for like 7 minutes. For the buns, I tossed
some generic frozen hot dog buns into the microwave for 40 seconds. Tossed the
dogs on, slathered on condiments, and ate them.

And were they fine... I think it really is hard to come by a comfort food quite
like hot dogs, especially in the time range that hot dogs are ready by.
