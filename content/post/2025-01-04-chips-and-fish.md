## Discussion

As a part of my New Year's resolutions, I decided that I would eat out once a
week. And as a condition for eating out, I would not be able to use DoorDash or
any other food delivery service, unless absolutely necessary.

So, after my visit to the local climbing gym, I stopped by St. Stephen's Green, 
an Irish pub located on Castro Street in Mountain View.

I've had their fish and chips before, but it is always a pleasure coming back.

Recently, one of my friends introduced me to colcannon, which is Irish mashed
potatoes with cabbage. So, I decided I had to try it as a side to my dinner.

Overall, my experience dining here was fantastic. The server was kind enough to 
bring me two extra sides of tartar sauce upon my request for more and was very
quick with service. Definitely would recommend to anyone considering visiting
the area.

## Review

Now, an astute individual might notice that most of my meal is potatoes, but
frankly that's a win in my book. Furthermore, the two potato dishes had very
different flavor and textural profiles. While the chips were both crispy and
soft and paired wonderfully with the tartar sauce, the colcannon was instead 
fluffy and creamy, needing no sauce to assist in its deliciousness.

The fish was also fantastic. The menu says it was 3/4ths of a pound!
The exterior was wonderfully crispy and perfectly salted and seasoned. They
don't call it "Ultimate Fish and Chips" for no reason I guess.
