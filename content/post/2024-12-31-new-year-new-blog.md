## Discussion

Hello all! I'm really happy to announce what I hope to be the start of a
long-running blog. We're starting things off in the new year (2025 woo-hoo!!! 
ðŸŽŠ) with a recount of last night's dinner and a great ending to 2024.

I decided around 6pm that I ought not to spend the night vegetating on my couch,
so I got ready and headed out to Eureka! on Castro Street in Mountain View, CA.
I think I was leaning towards going to another restaurant called Vida! -- a
tapas joint -- but they (along with half of the restaurants in the Bay Area)
closed at 10pm.

That's not nearly late enough for a New Year's Eve celebration dinner ðŸ«¤.

As it was the only restaurant open until midnight, and also had bar seating, I
thus set my sights on Eureka!

When I sat down at the bar, the first thing I noticed that It was **packed** and 
unfortunately understaffed. But, to be completely honest this actually was good
for me since that would mean I would get some built in pacing to both my food
and drinks.

After I got my orders in, I started paying more attention to the TVs. They had
the Times Square countdown hooked up on every single one of the screens. Par for
the course to be frank. But what really got me laughing was the fact that Planet
Fitness of all brands was the one on the side of all the 2025 merch.

But as the food arrived, I kinda just pushed that to the back of my brain and
tried to enjoy the meal.

## Review

### Food

I really like the food at Eureka!

But since I can't have much there since I'm pescatarian, I am usually confined
to a limited selection. Whenever I go, this is my usual.

#### Burger

As always I grabbed Eureka's Crispy Veggie Beet Burger. To those who haven't had
what bean-based burgers as of late, they really have improved and the addition
of the beets really helps.

However, it wasn't without issues. They went a little light on saucing and with
bean-based burgers you really need the sauce. So, as a result the burger was a
tad dry. Nothing too bad though.

#### Fries

The fries are heavenly, and if you ever go to Eureka! I would really recommend
trying them out. They pack a ton of umami and flavor into the otherwise
unassuming side dish.

The Parmesan cheese and truffle sauce pair really well together. They also
provide some much-needed moisture to the burger. Don't eat too many without a
glass of water on hand though. Even if they have enough to help out the burger,
the saltiness from the cheese is a slow acting drying agent in your mouth.

#### Brussel Sprouts

Unfortunately I didn't grab an image of this dish, but my was it good. They were
sautÃ©ed to crispy perfection and topped with an orange glaze.

The serving size was pretty substantial too! I really like having a good amount
of veg with the otherwise carb heavy meal. Though I do admit the glaze
definitely did not help on the health side of things.

### Drinks

#### Uncharted Forests

This one was my favorite of the night. It was extremely refreshing and clean and
reminded me of Blue Gatorade a bit ðŸ˜….

In all honesty, I loved the fresh notes and the overall profile, but thought
that it was a bit sour at times.

#### Strawberry -- Lychee Martini

A very sweet drink. A little too sweet in my opinion.

I did think that the sourness of the lemon mellowed out how harsh the sweetness
was, but it introduced the issue of having a bit too much of a bite.

Loved eating the lychee though.

#### Moscow Mule

A true classic and one of my favorite drinks. Hard to mess up and Eureka!
certainly did not.
