## Discussion

Man oh man... I have not had the pleasure of eating breakfast for dinner in a
long time. I am truly happy that I chose to partake in this time honored
tradition today.

On my plate I had two chocolate chip pancakes (of course made with Ghirardelli 
60% dark chocolate chips), cooked to golden perfection, then
with a thin layer of butter on top. To this, I added a larger pad of butter to
each of the cakes and then drizzled them in some delicious Grade A Dark Robust
maple syrup.

As the sides, I made three Morningstar vegetarian breakfast sausage links and a
hash brown patty, both fried to perfection in some quality Irish butter.

It's not often I have an American style breakfast as my dinner, so without
further ado, let me get to the review!

## Review

What can I say except that I truly indulged myself today.

The fluffy pancakes paired beautifully with the sweetness of the maple syrup
-- which is **much** better than normal syrup -- and the salty savoriness of the
two side dishes really tied it all together.

Were I to make the dish again, I think I would cut back on the amount of maple
syrup I used, because I did think that the end result was a tad on the sweet
side.

Otherwise, I think this meal was made to near perfection. The hash brown
especially. I fried the patty wonderfully, ensuring a nice even golden brown
exterior and a soft and tasty interior. I think next time I should make two of
the hash brown patties instead, as I was wishing for a bit more at the end.

One other thing I would like to see the next time I do American breakfast for
dinner is a nice glass of OJ. I normally don't keep orange juice on hand, but my
local grocery store is kind enough to sell single serving orange juice bottles
for the rare occasion I need it.
