## Discussion

Ok... I know. I forgot to take a picture.

But don't worry. This is offered fairly regularly at the work cafÃ©, so you'll
just have to wait until next time I get the fish to see the picture. Here's to
hoping I don't forget again.

Anyhow, today I had pan fried salmon along with a sun-dried tomato orzo and
roasted broccoli. This was from the fish station at the work cafÃ©, which is only
a three-minute walk from my desk (assuming the elevator is quick to arrive ðŸ˜…).

There are other options at work, but I felt that I should splurge a little since
it is a New Year after all. Usually though, I end up getting whatever daily
special they have since it almost always costs less than $10 and always comes
with a side dish. For reference, this lunch was $15.

There's also another cafÃ© a bit further away (around about a 
six-minute walk) that serves even cheaper food, but I was with coworkers today
and didn't want to bother them with the task of walking so far, especially when
the majority of them had meetings right after lunch.

## Review

Like I said above, this meal was definitely on the pricier side for work lunches.

This fact, along with the fish being slightly overdone resulted in me settling
on the "Ok" rating. Unfortunately, it wasn't something that I found to match the
price point I paid.

Ignoring the cost however, I think it makes a fairly compelling option as far as
work lunch is considered. The macros are quite good, it is filling, and the
convenience is unparalleled. I mean, you can literally order from an app and
pick it up at a scheduled time.

Certainly better than the food at some other offices I've visited.
