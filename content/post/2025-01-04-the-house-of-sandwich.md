## Discussion

Sometimes all a dude needs is a homemade sandwich to calm their heart. And I
suppose that today, I was that dude.

Using the leftover ingredients from [Peaky Burgers](/post/peaky-burgers),
some cheddar cheese, and some Tofurkey from the store, I tossed together a
sandwich.

There was no real occasion for this one, so I'll just skip to the review. And
it's going to be a short one at that

Oh. Before we get to that though, I'll share you a fun fact.

If you slice a sandwich diagonally you actually get less sandwich than if you
had sliced it straight on. Why is this? It's because the imperfect knife you use
tears away an amount of sandwich proportional to the length of the cut. So the
shorter the cut, the less sandwich is lost.

The more you know!

## Review

It was good. Good enough I'll probably make it tomorrow as well. I need to
polish off the Tofurkey before it goes bad, and there really is no better way to
accomplish this goal besides succumbing to the House of Sandwich.
