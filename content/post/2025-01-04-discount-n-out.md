## Discussion

Sometimes I do wonder where my work cafeteria gets its inspiration from. Truly
one of the biggest unsolved mysteries of our time...

To be clear work has this as an offering on Fridays fairly regularly, and I
always make it a point to purchase it.

Why?

Simple. I like burgers and this is the cheapest burger and side combo I can get
at work. Ordering a burger and side normally costs me around $12, but because
this is a special it comes out to only $9.

And against my usual habits, I ended up getting my lunch to go today because I
agreed to meet someone for a meeting. Time was tight, and I was hoping that if I
didn't eat fast enough, I could eat during the meeting.

## Review

Probably would have been `Great` had I not had burgers two meals in a row üòÜ.

Overall though it was really solid. I'm definitely a sucker for cheese and
toppings on fries. Speaking of which, I really should try poutine some time.

Honestly it is a far cry from what I've seen my friends get at In-N-Out but
alas, it's the best I can do until they start offering impossible
Double-Doubles.
