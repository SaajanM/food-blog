## Discussion

One of my Instacart orders came through recently and along with it came some
Impossible burger patties. Additionally, I was lucky enough to snag some butter
lettuce and on the vine tomatoes from the nearby grocery story.

With these fortuitous occurrences, I decided to make myself some burgers.

I took two Impossible patties, tossed them on the stove. After a flip I put on
some medium cheddar cheese on both patties. Then, in the air frier, I made some
fries.

Once the burger patties were done, I removed them from the stove and then
toasted some potato buns in the leftover fats from the patties.

I constructed the burger according to the template below and then ate it along
with the fries.

## Review

I'll keep it nice and tidy for this one.

My burgers, made my way, with fries I like. What more could I ask for?

Nothing except for more of the same I suppose.

Only thing keeping away the `Peak` rating is the fact that I had to use premade
patties and that I was lacking some toppings such as fried onions and avocado.
